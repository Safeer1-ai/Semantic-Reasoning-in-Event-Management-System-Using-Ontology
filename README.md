# Semantic-Reasoning-in-Event-Management-System-Using-Ontology
Ontology-based Event Management System using OWL, designed to improve semantic reasoning, conflict detection, and intelligent querying. Developed with Protégé, this project models key event components—such as Attendees, Vendors, Venues, and Schedules—and supports automated reasoning using Description Logic (DL).
